# JointJs demos

As you may notice, **JointJs v1.2** came out (finally!) with the support for the lodash v4. 
As for the backward compatibility, JointJS is still shipped with the lodash v3 dependency, so in the demo, you can find out a possible scenario how to make JointJS running with the lodash v4.
